# DnDDoorPuzzle
C# WPF puzzle for my Dungeons and Dragons group

Modify '''dict''', '''answer''', '''Img2String''', and '''Translate''' methods as well as '''glyph/?.png''' images to fit whatever language style you would like!
Make sure the '''answer''' and first entries in '''dict''' match to avoid translating smaller words first and skipping the answer.

This puzzle took my group of 4 about 45 minutes with pen/paper and hints including:
1. The translation, when read out, is a gramatically correct English sentence 
2. The name of a god, MAKARI is in the puzzle 
(This hint is important for getting their first row/column to lock. Put in ma-ka-ri as 3 glyphs then cycle the remaining until it locks.)
3. A complete row/column will lock into place once correct
4. There are 16 glyphs and 16 spaces; no glyph is repeated
